# Classification of Lumbar Spine Damages ‚Äì BackPropagation for Back

**Author:** Paul Schmelzer  
**Source Dataset:** RSNA Lumbar Spine Challenge (Radiological Society of North America)  
**Goal:** Classify degenerative lumbar spine conditions from MRI images using transfer learning (ResNet-50).

## üß† Project Overview
This project applies deep learning to MRI images of the lumbar spine to **classify degenerative conditions** that affect the spinal canal and nerve roots.  
The main motivation is to **support radiologists** by automating the detection of key spinal abnormalities.

---

## ü©ª Clinical Background
Degenerative spine conditions can cause pain and mobility loss.  
The challenge focuses on **five conditions** across **five spinal levels** (L1/L2‚ÄìL5/S1):

- Left Neural Foraminal Narrowing  
- Right Neural Foraminal Narrowing  
- Left Subarticular Stenosis  
- Right Subarticular Stenosis  
- Spinal Canal Stenosis  

Each condition is graded as **Normal/Mild**, **Moderate**, or **Severe**.

## üìä Dataset
- **Origin:** Kaggle RSNA Lumbar Spine Challenge  
- **Subjects:** ~2000 patients  
- **Images per patient:** ~40 sagittal MRI slices ‚Üí ~80,000 rows  
- **Focus for this project:** Left Neural Foraminal Narrowing at L5/S1  
- **Sampling:** 4,000 images per severity class (balanced by severity, not by person)  
- **Splits:**  
  - Train/Test ‚Üí 80 % / 20 %  
  - Train/Validation ‚Üí 80 % / 20 %  
- **Training time:** ‚âà 1 hour per epoch, early stopping after 5‚Äì9 epochs  

**MRI Types used:**
- Sagittal T1  
- Sagittal T2  
- Axial T2  

*(Sagittal views are better suited for detecting foraminal narrowing.)*

## üß© Methods
### Model Architecture
- **Transfer Learning:** Pretrained **ResNet-50** (ImageNet-1k weights)  
- **Purpose:** Handle gradient vanishing and extract hierarchical features from medical images  
- **Training variants:**
  1. **With bounding boxes** ‚Üí higher accuracy on localized regions (e.g., L5/S1)  
  2. **Without bounding boxes** ‚Üí trained on full images, better generalization  

### Early Stopping
- **Divergence-based:** stop if validation loss exceeds training loss by > 0.5 for ‚â• 5 epochs  
- **Plateau-based:** stop if validation loss fails to improve for ‚â• 5 epochs

## üìà Results
- **Baseline accuracy:** ‚âà 35 % (majority class)  
- **Final accuracy:** ‚âà 85 % on test set  

| Training Type | Performance | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| With Bounding Boxes | ‚≠ê Higher accuracy | Limited generalization |
| Without Bounding Boxes | ‚öôÔ∏è Slightly lower accuracy | Better generalization across disc levels |

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Extend classification to all spinal levels (L1/L2 ‚Äì L5/S1)  
- Localize damage regions (object detection or segmentation)  
- Compare model variants with/without bounding boxes  
- Explore other pretrained CNNs (EfficientNet, DenseNet)
