
just class one and two
reduce layeer geometically layers  512 divided by 4
1. If i will also fit the model for oter damages how to progess? Should it be done in separate steps using loops?

ugrade category 2 weights
U-net pretrained model

2. cases with medium and severity are undersampled in terms of study_id but equal in terms of images.

3. for 10000 pictures it took about 3 hours 



or 4. Add a Convolutional Layer: Adding a convolutional layer just before the fully connected layers might help /
extract more spatial features, especially if you have spatially informative data.

m_1.fc = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(m_1.fc.in_features, 512, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),  # Convolutional layer
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.BatchNorm2d(512),
    nn.Dropout(0.5),
    nn.Linear(512, train_df['severity'].nunique())
)


Incorporating Attention Mechanisms:
Attention mechanisms (e.g., self-attention or squeeze-and-excitation layers) can help the model focus
on the most relevant parts of the image, which could be beneficial for medical image tasks.


 










does it make sense to convert all pictures into 

check how much size have original pictures
